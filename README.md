# Task: Develop a Validation Pipeline with Parameterized Inputs, Two Extractors, and Two Validators

We need to build a pipeline to validate PDF data, specifically targeting the company name and date on the first (cover) page. Use as an input file `report.pdf`.

### Requirements for General Pipeline Logic:
- **Modular Design:** The pipeline should be easily extendable, allowing the addition of new extractors and validators without modifying the core logic.
- **Type Safety:** Use type annotations to enhance code clarity and catch potential issues early.
- **Component Separation:** Structure the code into distinct modules for extraction, validation, and the core pipeline logic, enabling independent operation and reusability of each module.
- **Independent Extractors and Validators:** The extractors and validators should function independently from the main pipeline logic, ensuring ease of integration and future modifications.
- **Error Handling and Reporting:** Include error handling within the pipeline to manage any unexpected issues during extraction or validation. Log or print clear error messages to facilitate troubleshooting.

### Requirements for Extractors:
- **Modular and Extensible:** Each extractor should be a separate class or module that can be easily replaced or extended with minimal impact on the main pipeline.
- **PDF Data Extraction:** The extractors should be able to identify and extract specific values from the PDF, in our case, the company_name and date from the cover page.
- **Error Handling:** If an extractor fails to find the required value, it should handle the error gracefully and return an appropriate response or log an error message.

### Requirements for Validators:
- **Ease of Expansion:** New validators should be simple to add, following a standard interface or protocol.
- **Field-Specific Validations:**
  - **Company Name Validator:** Confirms that the extracted company name matches the provided company_name argument.
  - **Date Validator:** Validates that the extracted date field aligns with the provided date argument in the YYYY-MM-DD format.
  - **Clear Feedback:** In case of validation failure, each validator should return a detailed message indicating what failed, along with the expected versus actual values.

### Expected Result
#### Modules:
- **General Pipeline Logic:** Manages the extraction and validation flow, coordinating data between extractors and validators.
- **Two Extractors:**
  - **Company Name Extractor:** Extracts the company name from the PDF's cover page.
  - **Date Extractor:** Extracts the date field from the cover page of the PDF.
- **Two Validators:**
  - **Company Name Validator:** Compares the extracted company name with the expected company_name parameter.
  - **Date Validator:** Checks that the extracted date matches the expected date parameter.

### Example Usage
For a successful validation:
```bash
python pipeline.py --company_name "Bluegem III GP SARL" --date "2023-12-31"
```
Expected output:
```bash
Company name validation passed.
Date validation passed.
```

For an unsuccessful validation:
```bash
python etl_pipeline.py --company_name "no name" --date "2025-12-31"
```
Expected output:
```bash
Company name validation failed: expected "no name", found "Bluegem III GP SARL".
Date validation failed: expected "2025-12-31", found "2023-12-31".
```
